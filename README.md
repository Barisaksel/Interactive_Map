World Interactive Map

We can see the borders of the countries, their populations, their capitals, places to visit in istanbul and unesco cultural heritage regions. We can examine these regions in more detail thanks to the satellite image if we want.
If we want, we can quickly go to the city we want with the search section. 
In addition, using the openweathermap api, we can view the temperature values in turkey on the map.
